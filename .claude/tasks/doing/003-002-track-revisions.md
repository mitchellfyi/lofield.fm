## Context

Users need to see the history of changes to their tracks, compare versions, and revert to previous versions. Each AI-generated change creates a new revision.

- Each chat response that changes code = new revision
- Users can browse history, see what changed
- Can revert to any previous version
- Diff view shows code changes between versions

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Auto-create revision on each code change from chat
- [ ] Revision includes: code, timestamp, optional message/prompt
- [ ] History panel showing list of revisions
- [ ] Click revision to preview (without loading)
- [ ] "Revert to this version" button
- [ ] Diff view comparing two revisions (side-by-side or unified)
- [ ] Current version indicator
- [ ] Limit revisions per track (e.g., keep last 50)
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Quality gates pass
- [ ] Changes committed with task reference

| Limit revisions per track (e.g., keep last 50)              | **NO**      | Need `pruneRevisions()` function in `lib/tracks.ts` + call after creating revision                                                        |
| Tests written and passing                                   | **PARTIAL** | Tests exist for `getRevisions()` and `createRevision()`. Need tests for new functions and hooks.                                          |
| Quality gates pass                                          | **TBD**     | Run after implementation                                                                                                                  |

#### Files to Modify

1. **`lib/tracks.ts`** - Server-side service layer
   - Add `pruneRevisions(userId, trackId, keepCount = 50)` function
   - Modify `createRevision()` to call `pruneRevisions()` after insert

2. **`lib/hooks/useTracks.ts`** - Client-side hooks
   - Add `createRevision(trackId, code, message)` function to hook result
   - Add revision-related API call functions

3. **`app/studio/page.tsx`** - Main studio page
   - Import new `RevisionHistory` component
   - Add state for `showRevisionHistory` toggle
   - Hook into chat response flow (after successful code extraction) to auto-create revision
   - Add "History" button in TopBar or CodePanel area
   - Pass revision preview/revert handlers to components

4. **`components/studio/TopBar.tsx`** - Top navigation bar
   - Add "History" button next to "My Tracks" to open revision history panel

5. **`app/api/tracks/[id]/revisions/route.ts`** - NEW API route
   - GET: List revisions for a track

6. **`app/api/tracks/[id]/revisions/[revisionId]/route.ts`** - NEW API route for single revision
   - GET: Fetch single revision (for diff comparison)

#### Files to Create

1. **`components/studio/RevisionHistory.tsx`** - Revision history panel component
   - Purpose: Modal/drawer showing list of revisions with timestamps
   - Props: `isOpen`, `onClose`, `trackId`, `currentCode`, `onRevert`, `onPreview`
   - Features:
     - List revisions ordered by created_at DESC
     - Show message (user prompt) if available
     - Highlight current version (where revision.code matches current_code)
     - Preview button (shows code in read-only view)
     - Revert button (updates track and creates new revision)
     - Select two revisions for diff comparison

2. **`components/studio/DiffView.tsx`** - Diff comparison component
   - Purpose: Show side-by-side or unified diff between two code versions
   - Props: `oldCode`, `newCode`, `mode: 'side-by-side' | 'unified'`
   - Use `diff` npm package for diff algorithm
   - Color-coded additions/deletions

3. **`lib/hooks/useRevisions.ts`** - Client-side hook for revisions
   - Purpose: Fetch and manage revisions for a track

4. **`lib/__tests__/tracks.test.ts`** - Update with new tests
   - Add tests for `pruneRevisions()` function

5. **`lib/hooks/__tests__/useRevisions.test.ts`** - NEW tests for revisions hook

#### Test Plan

- [ ] Test `pruneRevisions()` keeps only last N revisions
- [ ] Test `createRevision()` with message parameter
- [ ] Test revision list API returns correct order (newest first)
- [ ] Test revert creates new revision with reverted code
- [ ] Test diff view correctly highlights changes
- [ ] Test current version indicator matches track.current_code
- [ ] Test auto-revision on chat code change
- [ ] E2E: Open history, preview revision, revert to previous version

#### Docs to Update

- [ ] No documentation changes required (internal feature)

#### Implementation Order

1. Add `pruneRevisions()` to `lib/tracks.ts` and update `createRevision()`
2. Create API routes for revisions (`/api/tracks/[id]/revisions`)
3. Create `useRevisions` hook
4. Create `DiffView` component (dependency for history panel)
5. Create `RevisionHistory` component
6. Update `TopBar.tsx` with History button
7. Update `app/studio/page.tsx` to integrate history panel and auto-revision on chat
8. Write/update tests
9. Run quality gates

#### Dependencies

- Need to install `diff` npm package for diff algorithm (or use built-in string comparison)

#### Notes

- Original plan referenced wrong file (`app/strudel/page.tsx`) - corrected to `app/studio/page.tsx`
- Revisions table already exists with proper RLS policies from task 003-001
- `createRevision()` and `getRevisions()` already exist in `lib/tracks.ts`
- Main work is UI components and hooking into chat flow

### 2026-01-24 12:45 - Plan Complete

- Performed comprehensive gap analysis against all acceptance criteria
- Reviewed existing implementation:
  - `lib/tracks.ts`: `createRevision()` and `getRevisions()` already exist
  - `lib/types/tracks.ts`: `Revision` type already defined
  - Database: `revisions` table with proper schema and RLS policies
  - Tests: Basic tests exist for revision functions
- Identified gaps:
  - No UI components for revision history, diff view, or preview
  - No automatic revision creation on chat code changes
  - No revision pruning (cleanup) mechanism
  - No revert functionality
  - No API routes for client-side revision access
  - No `useRevisions` hook for client-side state management
- Created detailed implementation plan with:
  - 4 files to modify
  - 5 files to create
  - 8 test cases to implement
  - 9-step implementation order
- Key architectural decisions:
  - Use modal/drawer pattern for revision history (consistent with TrackBrowser)
  - Add `diff` npm package for code comparison
  - Prune to keep last 50 revisions per track
  - Auto-create revision in chat response flow (after successful code extraction)
  - Revert creates new revision (preserves history)

### 2026-01-24 11:13 - Triage Complete

- Dependencies: ✅ CLEAR - `003-001-save-tracks-db` is completed (verified in done/)
- Task clarity: Clear - acceptance criteria are specific and testable (11 checkboxes)
- Ready to proceed: Yes
- Notes:
  - Dependency task completed extensive foundation work:
    - Database: `projects`, `tracks`, `revisions` tables with RLS policies
    - Service layer: `lib/tracks.ts` with CRUD operations
    - API routes: Projects and tracks CRUD endpoints
    - Client hooks: `useProjects.ts`, `useTracks.ts` with state management
    - UI: `TrackBrowser.tsx`, `SaveButton.tsx` components
  - Revisions table already exists from dependency task
  - `createRevision()` function already exists in `lib/tracks.ts`
  - Current task focuses on:
    - Revision history UI (history panel component)
    - Diff view comparing revisions
    - Revert functionality
    - Auto-create revision on chat code changes
    - Revision cleanup (limit per track)
  - Plan references some files correctly (`lib/tracks.ts`, hooks)
  - Plan needs update: uses `app/strudel/page.tsx` but should be `app/studio/page.tsx`
  - May need diff library (`diff` or `diff2html`) for comparing code versions

## Notes

- Consider git-like branching in far future
- May want to mark certain revisions as "starred"
- Cleanup should run async (edge function or cron)
