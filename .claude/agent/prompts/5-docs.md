# Phase 5: DOCS (Documentation Sync)

You are synchronizing documentation for task {{TASK_ID}}.

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Check Documentation Requirements**
   - Review the task's acceptance criteria for doc requirements
   - Check if any `docs/*.md` files need updating
   - Look for outdated information in existing docs

2. **Update Relevant Documentation**
   - API documentation for new endpoints
   - Architecture docs for new patterns/services
   - README if user-facing features changed
   - Inline code comments for complex logic

3. **Ensure Consistency**
   - Code and docs must tell the same story
   - Update any references to renamed/moved code
   - Check for broken links in markdown files

4. **Task Documentation**
   - Update task file's Testing Evidence section
   - Complete the Notes section with observations
   - Update Links section with related files

5. **Check Model Annotations**

   ```bash
   bundle exec annotaterb models
   ```

   - Keep model annotations in sync with schema

## Output

```
